# ME hub
## An app [I made ages ago for WP7](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-me-hub.2861857/). Source no longer available, just uploading it here to keep track.

Original description from back then:

 
  
-=-INTRO-=-
 
I recently started trying to learn how to make windows phone apps. I've come to windows phone from android (back when ICS was the newest thing), and to my surprise Windows Phone did not have any way to save your own contact information in the 'me hub'. This was a bit annoying, as I did not fancy having to add myself as a contact and scroll through all my contacts whenever I wanted to share my number with someone. I finally decided to learn how to develop, and so, I've made this:...

-=-WHAT IS IT-=-
 
An alternative to the normal (and now-not-as-useful-as-it-once-was) Me tile. It allows you to share your contact info by tapping on it.
Install it using the XAP Deployment Tool. No interop required. Just normal Dev-unlock.

-=-NOTES-=-
 
My screenshot features a different header photo for the alternative view ( I didn't include it because I don't 'own' the picture. You can replace it by opening the XAP as an archive and editing the img.jpg image file.
Feedback is welcome!
...although I am very busy at the moment, and I am unsure when/if I will continue to update this app. (One idea was to add a 'post an update' feature that would open MultiShare, but I haven't yet done anything...
The small tile has a black background and a white, round design (not really a tile, more of a button/icon)
